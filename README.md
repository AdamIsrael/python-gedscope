# GEDScope

GEDScope is a tool to perform advanced analysis ancesteral information contained within [GEDCOM] files.

## History

I decided to write this tool because I found the user interfaces of Ancestry.com and its like to be frustrating at times. There was a lack of metadata search, confident analysis, or any other sort of functionality I could see being done against the datasets available.

I've started this tool as a way to develop the logic to perform that analyis.
